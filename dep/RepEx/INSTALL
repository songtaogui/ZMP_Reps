						    Installation Guide
						   ====================
						   
Installation guide for Linux machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Extract the tarfile by typing:

	--------------------------
=>	 "tar -xvzf RepEx.tar.gz"
 	--------------------------

1) After extracting the tarfile into the desired installation directory,
change to the "RepEx" directory.  Once in this directory, type:

	--------------
=>	 "make check"
	--------------

	This command will check for the necessary utilities, that the RepEx package
	depends on. If you see no error messages, the check was successful.

2) The following command will build the appropriate scripts and binaries in the corresponding
directory.

	----------------
=>	 "make install" 
	----------------

3) To check, if RepEx is installed properly, type the following

	-------------
=>	 "make test"
	-------------
   
4) To make RepEx accessible from different directories, simply add the full 
RepEx directory path to your system PATH, or link the RepEx to your favorite 
bin directory. 

	Recommended step:-

	a) In your .bashrc file located at your home directory, add the following lines

	----------------------------------------------
=> 	 PATH = bin_directory_of_RepEx:$PATH	
	----------------------------------------------

	### For instance, PATH=/home/user/Software/RepEx/src/bin:$PATH

Please note that the 'make' command dynamically generates the 
RepEx scripts with the appropriate paths, therefore if the RepEx directory 
is moved after the 'make' command is issued, the program will fail to run.
If the RepEx executables are needed in a directory other than the install directory, 
it is recommended that the install directory be left untouched and its files linked 
to the desired destination. An alternative would be to move the install directory 
and reissue the 'make' command at the new location.


Uninstallation
==============

	------------------				--------------
=> 	 "make uninstall"		or 		 "make clean"
	------------------				--------------
   This will remove all binary executables from the base and bin directories. 
   The original source files will remain unchanged,
   thus reverting the package to its post-untar, pre-install state.
   

Installation guide for Mac machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) As make is not readily available for Mac users, the Mac development kit (Xcode) must be downloaded and installed. This
kit will include 'gcc', 'ar', and 'make' that are necessary for building RepEx.

2) Follow the steps, as mentioned under "Installation guide for Linux machines"
